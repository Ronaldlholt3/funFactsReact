      <p>
        The shift from procedural to object-oriented programming (OOP) was a major paradigm shift. Languages like Smalltalk and C++ introduced concepts like classes, objects, and inheritance, allowing for more modular and maintainable code. This approach better mirrored real-world entities and interactions.
